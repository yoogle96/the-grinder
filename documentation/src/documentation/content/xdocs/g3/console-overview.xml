      <p>
        As described in <a
        href="site:getting-started/processes">Getting Started</a>, the
        console is a Java process that acts as the coordinator for the
        other processes; hosts a user interface; collates and displays
        statistics; and provides script editing and distribution.</p>

        <p>When you run The Grinder, a single console process is
        started on one of your computers. The agent processes on your
        load injector machines connect to this console.</p>

        <p>There are several types of user interface, described in
        more detail over the following pages.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="site:console/ui">Classic Interface</a>, a
          graphical user interface written using the Java Swing
          framework</li>
          <li>The <a href="site:console/service">Console Service</a>,
          a RESTful API</li>
          <li>The <a href="site:console/webui">Web Interface</a>, a
          HTML5 user interface, accessible using a web browser</li>
        </ul>
