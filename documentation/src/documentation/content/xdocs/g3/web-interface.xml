      <p>
        The web interface allows the console to be controlled from a
        web browser. We expect that it will eventually replace the <a
        href="site:console/ui>">classic interface</a>. The web
        interface has several advantages. It can be accessed
        concurrently by more than one user. It can be used from any
        computer on networked to the console host machine. The user
        interface is modern, and is <em>mashable</em> into other
        interfaces and portals.</p>

        <p>The initial release in The Grinder 3.12 is usable, but does
        not have the full capability of the classic interface. In
        particular, saving results, <a
        href="site:console/ui/distribute">script distribution</a>, and
        <a href="site:console/ui/edit">script editing</a> are all
        missing. Until these features have been implemented, you may
        want to use the classic interface and the web interface
        together.</p>

      <title>How to access the web interface</title>

      <p>The web interface shares its <a
      href="site:console/service/configuration">configuration</a> with
      the console service. With the default configuration, once the
      console process has started, you can access the web console on
      your local computer at <a
      href="http://localhost:6373/ui">http://localhost:6373/ui</a>.</p>

      <p>The default configuration binds to all local interfaces, so
      you can change <em>localhost</em> in the URL to an externally
      accessible host name or IP address. You should understand the <a
      href="site:console/service/security">security implications</a>
      of remote access.</p>
